# Blue Team Portfolio — Adolfo Daniel Santos

This repository documents my **hands-on journey into Defensive Cybersecurity (Blue Team)**.

It is structured as a progressive roadmap, covering:
- System fundamentals
- Linux & Windows security
- Log analysis & monitoring
- Network traffic analysis
- SIEM implementation
- Incident response & threat hunting

## Goal
Build real-world Blue Team skills through practical labs, documentation and reproducible projects, aiming for SOC Analyst and Defensive Security roles.
